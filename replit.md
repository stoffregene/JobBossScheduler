### Prompt: Implement Shift Capacity Load Balancing
This update implements a new shift-based load balancing system to distribute work more evenly between the 1st and 2nd shifts based on their relative capacity and efficiency.

This update requires creating one new file, replacing one existing file, and updating one API endpoint.
